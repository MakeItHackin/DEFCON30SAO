## DESCRIPTION:  
The Deluxe Boozeboard is a SAO made for DEF CON 30 "Homecoming."  Inspired by the 1990s, this SAO is shaped like a Talkboy from Home Alone 2.  

The SAO has three main features:  
1) Alcohol sensor   (still being programmed... stay tuned for more details)  
2) Video game (still being programmed... stay tuned for more details)  
3) Flashy Badge mode (for blinking lights while walking around the conference)  

The SAO can either be powered by a badge with a proper SAO port or by a micro-usb cable (usb cable not included)  

The nozzle is 3D printed and mouth covers are provided for sanitary use.  The user should not place their mouth directly on the 3D printed material.  Only place mouth on the provided covers.  

Although this SAO features the MQ303A alcohol sensor, it is for entertainment and educational purposes only and should not be used to determine actual levels of alcohol in a person's system.  If you have had any amount to drink, you should wait until sober until driving and please drink responsibly.  This project does not encourage consumption of alcohol.  

Also included are special homecoming-themed DEF CON 30 stickers!
